> *"Where truth is blogged."* — A simple blog post manager for sharing thoughts and stories.

##  Description

**Ukweli Social** is a frontend CRUD app built to help users create, view, update, and delete blog posts with ease. Designed for fast, local use, it helps simplify blogging — from writing a new post to editing mistakes or removing outdated ones.

This project is especially useful in situations like public terminals, mobile cafes, or anywhere you'd like to manage posts offline using a mock API.

##  Features

- View all blog post titles
- See post details by clicking a title
- Add new blog posts via a form
- Edit an existing post’s title or content
- Delete unwanted posts
- Responsive and clean UI

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (as a mock RESTful API)
- Live Server (for running the frontend)
